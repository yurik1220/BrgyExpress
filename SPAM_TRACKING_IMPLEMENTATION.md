## üìä Database Schema Changes

### New Columns in `users` Table
```sql
- spam_points INTEGER DEFAULT 0
- disabled_at TIMESTAMPTZ
- account_status TEXT DEFAULT 'active'
```

### New Table: `spam_logs`
Tracks all spam-related events for auditing and analytics:
```sql
CREATE TABLE spam_logs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    clerk_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    request_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    request_id INTEGER,
    rejection_reason TEXT,
    spam_points_before INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    spam_points_after INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    account_status_before TEXT,
    account_status_after TEXT,
    action TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    FOREIGN KEY (clerk_id) REFERENCES users (clerk_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Web Admin Interface Updates

### Account Maintenance Page
- **New Column**: "Spam Score" shows points (e.g., 3/7)
- **Color Coding**:
  - Green: < 5 points
  - Orange: 5-6 points  
  - Red: 7+ points
- **Account Status Display**: Shows active/disabled_temp/disabled_perm

### Analytics Dashboard

---

## üö´ Request Blocking Logic

### Automatic Enforcement
When users attempt to submit any request:
1. System checks `account_status` field
2. **Temporary Disable**: Shows remaining hours and blocks submission
3. **Permanent Disable**: Shows spam points and directs to contact admin
4. Auto-lift expired temporary bans if they're past 24 hours

### Error Response for Disabled Users
```json
{
  "error": "Account temporarily disabled",
  "message": "Your account is temporarily disabled due to spam points (5/7). It will be re-enabled in approximately 12 hours.",
  "spamPoints": 5,
  "status": "disabled_temp",
  "remainingHours": 12
}
```

---

## üîÑ Automatic Background Processing

### Hourly Auto-Lift Check
- Runs every 60 minutes
- Finds users with `disabled_temp` status older than 24 hours
- Automatically lifts the ban and logs the action
- Sends notifications to affected users

### Spam Logging
Every spam-related event is logged with:
- User ID and request details
- Spam points before/after
- Account status before/after
- Timestamp and action type

---

## üìà Analytics Insights

### Metrics Tracked
1. **Total Rejected Submissions** - Total count across all request types
2. **Average Spam Score** - Mean spam points for all users
3. **Disabled User Count** - Breakdown by temp vs permanent
4. **Top Offenders** - Users with highest spam points
5. **Rejection Rate** - Percentage of total submissions rejected

### Visualizations
- **Metric Cards**: Large, color-coded KPI displays
- **Top Offenders Table**: Ranked list with medal badges (gold/silver/bronze)
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded for quick identification

---

## üé® User Experience

### For Users
- Clear error messages when account is disabled
- Information about when account will be re-enabled
- Spam points visible in account maintenance
- Transparent system with clear rules

### For Admins
- Comprehensive analytics dashboard
- Easy identification of problematic users
- Manual control over permanent bans
- Complete audit trail via spam_logs
- Visual indicators for quick status checks

---

## üîê Security Features

1. **Admin-only Endpoints**: Lift ban endpoint requires admin authentication
2. **Audit Logging**: All spam actions logged in audit_logs
3. **Rate Limiting**: Analytics endpoints protected with rate limiting
4. **Database Constraints**: Foreign key relationships maintain data integrity

---

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Database Migration
Run the following to ensure all columns exist:
```bash
# The server.js automatically adds missing columns on startup
# No manual migration needed
```

### Configuration
No additional configuration required. The system activates automatically on server startup.

### Monitoring
Check logs for spam-related events:
- `üö® Spam tracking:` - Point increments
- `üîÑ Found X users with expired temporary bans` - Auto-lift operations
- `‚úÖ Admin X lifted permanent ban for Y` - Manual interventions

---

## üìù Files Modified
