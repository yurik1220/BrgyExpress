# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

## Cloudinary uploads (optional, recommended)

Set these env vars to enable direct uploads to Cloudinary from the mobile app (free tier works):

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=unsigned_preset
```

Notes:
- Create an unsigned upload preset in Cloudinary and allow image uploads.
- If these are not set, the app falls back to uploading via `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` at `/api/upload-image`.
This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
